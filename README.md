A restaurant buzzer app for our CS&E 694 class.  The purpose of this app is to
allow users to "check in" to a restaurant to reserve a place in line for a seat.
The user of the admin app for a restaurant can chose when to seat the next group
of a given size, and that group's phone will then receive an alert, allowing 
them to accept or reject the seat.

This is implemented using bluetooth for communication and local storage on the 
phones for user accounts and restaurant info to save time.  To make the app 
actually useful, a server would have to be implemented to replace these 
functions.
